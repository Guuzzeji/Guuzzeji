Hi, my name is Gabe (I also go by Guuzzeji) and I'm a young self-taught developer that really enjoys technology, along with creating stuff. I mostly work with Node.js and JavaScript; however, I do understand a good chunk of Python. Plus, I am always open to learning a new programming language and new things because that is how you grow as a developer.
